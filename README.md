# ESOV Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
The ESOV (Excess Share of Voice) Analysis Dashboard is a comprehensive analytical tool designed to help businesses measure and optimize their marketing and advertising investments. By analyzing Share of Voice (SOV) and Share of Market (SOM), the dashboard provides insights into competitive positioning, efficiency of advertising spend, and the potential impact of budget adjustments.

## What is ESOV?
**ESOV (Excess Share of Voice)** is a key marketing metric that represents the difference between a brandâ€™s Share of Voice (SOV) and its Share of Market (SOM):

\[ ESOV = SOV - SOM \]

- **Share of Voice (SOV)**: The percentage of total category advertising spending a brand controls.
- **Share of Market (SOM)**: The percentage of total category sales a brand owns.

A **positive ESOV** (SOV > SOM) typically indicates that a brand is investing more in advertising relative to its market share, which may lead to future growth. Conversely, a **negative ESOV** (SOV < SOM) suggests that a brand is underinvesting compared to its market position, potentially risking a decline in market share.

## Why is ESOV Important?
1. **Predicts Market Share Growth**: Research suggests that higher ESOV often correlates with future market share gains.
2. **Guides Strategic Investment**: Identifies whether a brand is over-investing, under-investing, or optimally spending on advertising.
3. **Enhances Budget Allocation**: Helps brands allocate marketing budgets more effectively across different markets and brands.
4. **Benchmarks Competitive Positioning**: Provides insights into how a brand compares to competitors in terms of advertising presence.
